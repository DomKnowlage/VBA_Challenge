# VBA_Challenge
A compiled list of stock analysis

## Overview ##

The goal of this analysis is to showcase vairous stock performances throughout 2017 and 2018. Utilizing some premanufcatured code, we worked backwards to speed up the performance of the existing code as well as debug it so we can have a clear view of the stock data. Doing this paints a picture of which stocks have a history of growth and which stocks have a more rocky trajectory.

As we can see from the 2017 data a majoity of the stocks had a very good year with DQ gaining almost 200%. If you were able to get on the ground floor of this project you will be very satisfied with your ROI. Now, our formatting could be improved, the colors dont necessairly reflect the positive and negitive returns but we can always go back and rework it. With refactoring this code we have been able to cut down the processing time to retrieving billions of stock trades in less than a second.

Now lets take a look at the 2018 stock analysis. This was more of a down year for our stocks, as they say you can't win all the time, Hopefully our DQ shareholders sold their shares in time, even if they didn't they're still up over from their initial buy in, but still that negaitive is scary. As far as processing speed goes it went a little slower, a snail's pace of 1.7 seconds, but there appears to be a larger amount of trades throughout the year which could explain the longer run time.

Refactoring appears to be a give and take process, its great because you can take some of your old code and format it into a new layout to suit your new goals. The bad can stem from having to go back and go through each line and debug it to run properly Overall it does cut down the time it takes to get the code up and running so I can't necessairly complain about the process. I just need to get more familiar with the conditionals and formatting in VBA.
